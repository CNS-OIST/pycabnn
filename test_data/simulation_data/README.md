# How to download simulation data



Data sets from simulations of the cerebellar granular network can be downloaded at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11880693.

*  BREP.zip contains the simulation data based on the original software, BREP, used in Sudhakar et al. (2017).
* Pycabnn.zip contains the one based on a new software, pycabnn.

Download those two files and unarchive them here. For example plots, see ../../notebooks/fig_NESTSIM/Compare_simulation_results.ipynb.
