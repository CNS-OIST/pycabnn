# Cell position generator

## Project goal

This project aims to replace current programs embedded in the CBX simulation to generate cell positions and compute distance-based connectivity by better one.

## Current status

1.  Mossy fibers/glomeruli are generated by MATLAB functions,
2.  For all other cells, positions are generated by random integers (`main.py --initpop`).

## Strategy

1. Generate cell positions based on a soft sphere packing scheme,
2. Validate with experimental data,
3. Explore consequences in
    1. connectivity,
    2. simulations.

Here we try the [possion-disk sampling algorithm](https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/) for generating tightly packed soft spheres.

- [x] Working prototypes for the 2d and 3d. Tuesday, October 30, 2018
- [ ] Extension to a larger scale by a patchwork scheme.
- [ ] Fill the entire 1500um x 750um x 350um volume with cells.

### Comparison with the data

[TÃ¶pperwien et al. (2018)](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/27/6940) obtained a large scale position data for the granule cells and MINs from human cerebellums. Here we aim to analyze this data and compare with the generated points.

- [ ] Reproduce their analysis.
- [ ] Analyze the granule cell position data.
- [ ] Analyze the MIN position data.

### Translate the mossy fiber MATLAB functions

Here we translate the mossy fiber/GL point generation to Python.
